This is a helper class to help you with getting Video Out working with
your iPhone OS 3.2 or greater SDK-OK application.

The core is the BLVideoOut.[hm] files, in the "Common" folder.

There is an example that shows their use.

V1.0: (2010-May-02)
	NOTE: it currently works only if the display is connected at 
	startup.  I'm looking into tracking down this issue right now.
