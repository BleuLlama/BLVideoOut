This is a helper class to help you with getting Video Out working with
your iPhone OS 3.2 or greater SDK-OK application.

Note: By weak-linking UIKit, you can use this on older iOS releases.  This is
      useful if you want to release your app for 3.0, and allow for video out
      on 3.2+ devices that allow for video out. (iPhone 4, iPad)

The core is the BLVideoOut.[hm] files, in the "Common" folder.

There is an example that shows their use.

V1.2: (2010-Sep-04)
	Added .canProvideVideoOut property - you can use this to determine
	if video out is even a possibility on the running device.  This 
	will be set to 'YES' when the device is capable of doing Video Out.
	In these cases, this is 'YES' whether there is a video out device
	attached or not.
	Also adjusted startup code to accomodate this.

V1.1: (2010-May-25)
	Works 100% now!  Thanks, Steve Doss!

V1.0: (2010-May-02)
	NOTE: it currently works only if the display is connected at 
	startup.  I'm looking into tracking down this issue right now.
